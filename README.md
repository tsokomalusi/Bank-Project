Selenium automation live project

## Day 1: Project Kickoff

Hi Fellow Tester, 
You are the Selenium automation engineer assigned to test the esteemed "Guru99 Bank" project.
Here is a link to the AUT - [Guru99 Bank Home Page](http://www.demo.guru99.com/V4/)
The following test case needs to be automated -

![test_scenario_v1](https://github.com/tsokomalusi/Bank-Project/blob/master/resources/images/test_scenario_v1.png)

The client has requested you to use WebDriver (Firefox Driver) for the project. Go ahead and record the script in Webdriver.

## Day 2: Enhancements in Script

Hey there,

There is a major flaw in the test case we created. There is no verification step.The script is no-good if it cannot produce Pass & Fail Status. 
Go ahead and modify the script

## Day3: Parameterizing the Script

Hi Fellow Geek,
 
The client has enhanced the test scenario to include more test cases

![test_scenario_v3](https://github.com/tsokomalusi/Bank-Project/blob/master/resources/images/test_scenario_v3.png)

One approach to automate this is to record separate script for all the above test cases. But this defeats the very purpose of automation.
 
The best technique to automate the above test suite  is to parametrize the script.
 
The most famous tool store data for parametrization is MS Excel.
 
Go ahead and create a script to read test-data from an Excel and execute Webdriver test cases.
 
Regards
Team Guru99

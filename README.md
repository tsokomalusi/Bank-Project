Selenium automation live project

## Day 1

Hi Fellow Tester, 
You are the Selenium automation engineer assigned to test the esteemed "Guru99 Bank" project.
Here is a link to the AUT - [Guru99 Bank Home Page](http://www.demo.guru99.com/V4/)
The following test case needs to be automated -

![test_case_v1](https://github.com/tsokomalusi/Bank-Project/blob/master/resources/images/test_case_v1.png)

The client has requested you to use WebDriver (Firefox Driver) for the project. Go ahead and record the script in Webdriver.

## Day 2: Enhancements in Script

Hey there,

There is a major flaw in the test case we created. There is no verification step.The script is no-good if it cannot produce Pass & Fail Status. 
Go ahead and modify the script
